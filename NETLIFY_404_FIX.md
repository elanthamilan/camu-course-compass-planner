# Fixing Netlify 404 Errors for CSS/JS Files

## Problem
You're seeing these errors in Netlify:
```
index-CdzfELFL.js:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
index-TLa1aqjK.css:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## Root Cause
The issue is typically caused by incorrect base path configuration in Vite, causing the browser to look for assets in the wrong location.

## Solution Applied

I've updated the configuration files to fix this issue:

### 1. Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Fixed base path detection for Netlify
- Added proper build configuration
- Ensured assets are placed in correct directory

### 2. Updated `netlify.toml`
- Added `VITE_NETLIFY=true` environment variable
- Ensured proper build environment

### 3. Key Changes Made

**vite.config.ts:**
```typescript
base: (process.env.NETLIFY === 'true' || process.env.CONTEXT === 'production') ? '/' : (mode === 'production' ? '/camu-course-compass-planner/' : '/'),
```

**netlify.toml:**
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NETLIFY = "true"
  VITE_NETLIFY = "true"
```

## Steps to Fix Your Deployment

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve Netlify 404 errors for assets"
git push origin refactor/schedule-functionality
```

### 2. Trigger New Netlify Build
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
- Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables, ensure:
- `NETLIFY` = `true`
- `VITE_NETLIFY` = `true`
- `NODE_VERSION` = `18`

### 4. Check Build Logs
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click on the latest deploy
3. Check build logs for any errors
4. Ensure build completes successfully

## Debug Steps

### 1. Run Debug Script
```bash
npm run build
node debug-netlify.cjs
```

This will analyze your build output and identify any issues.

### 2. Test Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open http://localhost:4173 and check if assets load correctly.

### 3. Check Network Tab
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Look for 404 errors and note the exact URLs being requested

## Common Causes & Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong Base Path
**Symptom**: Assets requested from wrong URL
**Solution**: Ensure `base` in vite.config.ts is set to `'/'` for Netlify

### Issue 2: Missing Environment Variables
**Symptom**: Build uses wrong configuration
**Solution**: Set `NETLIFY=true` and `VITE_NETLIFY=true` in Netlify

### Issue 3: Build Output Issues
**Symptom**: Assets not generated correctly
**Solution**: Check build logs, ensure all dependencies are installed

### Issue 4: Caching Issues
**Symptom**: Old assets being served
**Solution**: Clear Netlify cache and redeploy

## Verification Checklist

After deploying the fix:

- [ ] Site loads without 404 errors
- [ ] CSS styles are applied correctly
- [ ] JavaScript functionality works
- [ ] All pages are accessible
- [ ] React Router navigation works
- [ ] No console errors

## If Issues Persist

### 1. Manual Environment Variable Setup
In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add: `NETLIFY` = `true`
3. Add: `VITE_NETLIFY` = `true`
4. Redeploy

### 2. Alternative Build Command
Try using the explicit Netlify build command:
```toml
command = "npm run build:netlify"
```

### 3. Check File Paths
Ensure your `index.html` references assets with absolute paths:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/index-TLa1aqjK.css">
<script src="/assets/index-CdzfELFL.js"></script>
```

### 4. Contact Support
If the issue persists:
1. Check Netlify community forums
2. Review Vite deployment documentation
3. Verify all configuration files are correct

## Expected Result

After applying these fixes, your Netlify deployment should:
- Load all CSS and JS files correctly
- Display the application without 404 errors
- Function identically to local development
- Handle React Router navigation properly

The application will be available at your Netlify URL with full functionality.
