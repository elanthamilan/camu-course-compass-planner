   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select your repository
   - Choose `refactor/schedule-functionality` branch

3. **Verify Settings**
   - Build command: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - Publish directory: `dist` (auto-detected)
   - Node.js version: 18 (from `.nvmrc`)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy

## 🔧 Configuration Features

### Environment Detection
- Automatically detects Netlify deployment
